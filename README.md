# Exercise 6.1.2: GenericMethods with Persona Class

## Description

This exercise involves creating a `Persona` class with attributes for `name`, `surname`, and `age`. Additionally, a `GenericMethods` class is created, containing a generic method that accepts three arguments of any type. This method will simply print the received arguments to the console. The main method of the primary class will demonstrate the use of the generic method with different parameter types.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- An IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or a simple text editor.

## Class Implementations

### `Persona` Class

The `Persona` class should include the following attributes:

- `name`: A `String` representing the person's name.
- `surname`: A `String` representing the person's surname.
- `age`: An `int` representing the person's age.

### GenericMethods Class

The GenericMethods class should include a generic method to accept three parameters of any type and print them.

### Main Class

In the main method, create instances of Persona, use a String, and a primitive type to demonstrate the generic method.

## How It Works
- Persona Class: Represents a person with name, surname, and age attributes.

- Generic Method: The printArguments method in the GenericMethods class accepts any three parameters of the same type and prints them to the console.

- Demonstration: The main method creates instances of different types and calls the generic method, demonstrating its flexibility.

### Testing
To test the implementation:

- Compile all classes.

- Run the Main class.

- Observe the output in the console to see the printed arguments.
